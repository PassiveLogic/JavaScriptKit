// MARK: - Web Worker Task Executor

/// A task executor that runs tasks on Web Worker threads.
///
/// ## Prerequisites
///
/// This task executor is designed to work with [wasi-threads](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads)
/// but it requires the following single extension:
/// The wasi-threads implementation should listen to the `message` event
/// from spawned Web Workers, and forward the message to the main thread
/// by calling `_swjs_enqueue_main_job_from_worker`.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let executor = WebWorkerTaskExecutor(numberOfThreads: 4)
/// defer { executor.terminate() }
///
/// await withTaskExecutorPreference(executor) {
///   // This block runs on the Web Worker thread.
///   await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in
///     for i in 0..<10 {
///       // Structured child works are executed on the Web Worker thread.
///       group.addTask { fibonacci(of: i) }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ````
///
/// ## Known limitations
///
/// Currently, the Cooperative Global Executor of Swift runtime has a bug around
/// main executor detection. The issue leads to ignoring the `@MainActor`
/// attribute, which is supposed to run tasks on the main thread, when this web
/// worker executor is preferred.
///
/// ```swift
/// func run(executor: WebWorkerTaskExecutor) async {
///   await withTaskExecutorPreference(executor) {
///     // This block runs on the Web Worker thread.
///     await MainActor.run {
///         // This block should run on the main thread, but it runs on
///         // the Web Worker thread.
///     }
///   }
///   // Back to the main thread.
/// }
/// ````
